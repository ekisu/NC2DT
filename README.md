NC2DT is a osu! tool that allows one to convert their beatmaps' audio so that they, when
used with the Nightcore (NC) mod, sound the same as the Double Time (DT) mod.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release, from the [Releases]() page.
2. Extract and run the `NC2DT.exe` executable.
3. Type into the search bar the name of the beatmap you want to create a NC2DT audio, and
double-click it in the results listing.
4. Click the _Create Converted Audio_ button to create the converted audio.
5. Switch between the normal and NC2DT versions of the audio using the _Switch to Original/NC2DT Audio_ button.

**Note:** If you also want to get rid of the nightcore beats, download [these silent effects]() (found originally [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/617312)) and put them into your skin folder.

## Development

### Building (Windows)

You'll need Python 3.7 installed, and added to your `PATH`.
